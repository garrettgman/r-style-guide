## Spacing

Put a space after the bang operators (`!!` and `!!!`) but not
before them. Do not confuse `!!` and `!!!` with`!`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
call(!! xyz)

# Bad
call( !! xyz)
call(! !xyz)
```

## Operator precedence

Since all arithmetic and comparison operators bind more tightly than bang
operators, one should be explicit about operator precedence. Enclose the
expression to unquote in parenthesis if arithmetic or comparison operators are 
involved.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bad
quo(1 + !! 1 + 2 + 3)

# Good
quo(1 + (!! 1 + 2 + 3))
```
