# Files {#package-files}

The majority of advice in Chapter \@ref(files) also applies to files in packages. Important differences are described below. 

## Names

* If a file contains a single function, give the file the same name as the 
  function.

* If a file contains multiple related functions, give it a concise,
  but evocative name.
  
* Deprecated functions should live in a file with `deprec-` prefix.

* Compatibility functions should live in a file with `compat-` prefix.
